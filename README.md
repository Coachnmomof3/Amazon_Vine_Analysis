# Amazon_Vine_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis
This project was utilizing Amazons RDS and uploading that data into PostgreSQL to query data either in SQL or in Jupyter Notebooks: Google Collaboratory. With this specific dataset we are going to determine if there was a bias with Amazon review on Sports Items for the Vine Program. This Vine Program for Amazon is a invitation only based program in which Amazon wants to get the most trusted reviewers on Amazon to post opinions about new and pre-release items to help their fellow customers make informed purchase decisions.

* Not-Vine: 61614

### How many Vine reviews were 5 stars? How many non-Vine reviews were 5 stars?
* Vine: 139
* Not-Vine: 32665

### What percentage of Vine reviews were 5 stars? What percentage of non-Vine reviews were 5 stars?
* Vine: 41.62%
* Not-Vine: 53.02%

## Summary

For the Sports Items in the Vine Program there the test is inconclusive since our number of total reviews for Vine is significantly lower than Not-Vine Reviews plays a major role in this analysis. There is negative bias since it is about 12 percentage points lower than the non-Vine review. We would need to have equal or less Vine reviews to non-vine reviews to gather a more insightful answer to this problem. We could use ANOVA testing but would still need a larger sample to use this statistical test. By randomly selecting reviews on both groups we could determine their percentages and see if there is a positive bias in the Vine Program reviews.
